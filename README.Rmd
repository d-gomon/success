# success

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of the success package is to allow easy applications of continuous time CUSUM procedures on survival data. Specifically, the Biswas \& Kalbfleisch CUSUM (2008) and the CGR-CUSUM (2021).

Besides this, it allows for the construction of the Binary CUSUM chart and funnel plot on survival data as well.

## Installation

You can install the released version of success from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("success")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("d-gomon/success")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to construct a CGR-CUSUM chart on a hospital from the attached data set "surgerydat":

```{r success}
library(success)
library(survival)
tdat <- subset(surgerydat, hosp_num == 1)
tcbaseh <- function(t) chaz_exp(t, lambda = 0.01)

exprfit <- as.formula("Surv(survtime, censorid) ~ age + sex + BMI" )
tcoxmod <- coxph(exprfit, data= surgerydat)

#Alternatively, cbaseh can be left empty when specifying coxphmod through coxph()
cgr <- cgr_cusum(data = tdat, coxphmod = tcoxmod, cbaseh = tcbaseh, pb = TRUE)
plot(cgr)
```

You can plot the figure with control limit $h = 3$ by using:
```{r}
plot(cgr, h = 3)
```

And determine the runlength of the chart when using control limit $h = 4$:
```{r}
runlength(cgr, h = 4)
```

Hospital 1 would be detected by a CGR-CUSUM with control limit $h = 4$ after $102$ days.


Alternatively, you can construct the CGR-CUSUM only until it crosses control limit $h = 3$ by:
```{r}
cgr <- cgr_cusum(data = tdat, coxphmod = tcoxmod, cbaseh = tcbaseh, pb = TRUE, h = 3)
plot(cgr)
```
